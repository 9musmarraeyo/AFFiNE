Blue Is The Warmest Colour (2013) is a powerful and realistic portrayal of love, passion, and identity. It explores the complexities of human emotions and relationships, as well as the challenges of growing up and finding oneself. The film features outstanding performances by Seydoux and Exarchopoulos, who bring their characters to life with authenticity and intensity. The film is not for everyone, as it contains graphic sexual content and some scenes that may be uncomfortable or disturbing for some viewers. However, for those who appreciate a bold and honest cinematic experience, Blue Is The Warmest Colour (2013) is a must-see film.
  
The film is divided into two chapters, each covering a different stage of AdÃ¨le and Emma's relationship. The first chapter focuses on AdÃ¨le's adolescence and her discovery of her sexuality. She meets Emma, a confident and artistic blue-haired woman, who awakens her desire and curiosity. They fall in love and start a passionate affair, which AdÃ¨le keeps secret from her conservative parents and judgmental friends. The second chapter follows AdÃ¨le's adulthood and her career as a kindergarten teacher. She lives with Emma, who has become a successful painter. However, their relationship faces difficulties as they grow apart and face temptations from other people. AdÃ¨le struggles to cope with her loneliness and insecurity, while Emma seeks more freedom and creativity.
 
The film is praised for its realistic and intimate depiction of lesbian love and sexuality. The film does not shy away from showing the physical and emotional aspects of the relationship, including the long and explicit sex scenes that have been both lauded and criticized by critics and audiences. The film also explores the themes of social class, gender roles, art, and culture, as well as the joys and pains of love. The film is influenced by the works of Marivaux, Sartre, Egon Schiele, and Klimt.
 
The film is based on the graphic novel Blue Is the Warmest Color by Jul Maroh, which was published in 2010. The graphic novel tells the story of Clementine, a teenage girl who falls in love with Emma, a blue-haired woman. The graphic novel is told from Clementine's perspective after her death, as Emma reads her diaries. The graphic novel differs from the film in several ways, such as the names of the characters, the setting, the timeline, and the ending. The graphic novel is more tragic and melancholic than the film, which has a more hopeful tone. The graphic novel also has a more political and feminist approach than the film.
