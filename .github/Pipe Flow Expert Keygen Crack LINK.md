# How to Use Pipe Flow Expert Software for Pipe System Design and Analysis
 
Pipe Flow Expert is a software application that helps you design and analyze complex pipe networks where the flows and pressures must be balanced. It is used by engineers in over 100 countries worldwide for various industries such as aerospace, chemical processing, mining, power generation, water and wastewater processing, etc. In this article, we will show you how to use Pipe Flow Expert software for pipe system design and analysis.
 
## Step 1: Create a New Project
 
To start a new project, open Pipe Flow Expert software and click on the File menu. Then select New Project. You will see a blank drawing area where you can draw your pipe system. You can also choose a template from the File menu to use a predefined pipe system layout.

## Step 2: Draw Your Pipe System
 
To draw your pipe system, you can use the toolbar buttons or the keyboard shortcuts to add pipes, fittings, valves, pumps, tanks, components, and text labels. You can also use the mouse to drag and drop items from the database windows. You can adjust the properties of each item by double-clicking on it or using the property grid. You can also use the zoom and pan tools to navigate the drawing area.
 
## Step 3: Define Your Fluid Data
 
To define your fluid data, you can use the Fluids Database window to select a fluid from the list of common liquids and gases. You can also add your own custom fluid by clicking on the Add button. You can specify the fluid density, viscosity, vapor pressure, compressibility factor, and thermal expansion coefficient. You can also assign different fluids to different pipes if you have a mixed fluid system.

## Step 4: Define Your Calculation Options
 
To define your calculation options, you can use the Calculation Options window to select the calculation method, units, and tolerances. You can choose between Darcy-Weisbach or Hazen-Williams methods for pressure loss calculations. You can also choose between Colebrook-White or Swamee-Jain equations for friction factor calculations. You can also set the units for flow rate, pressure, length, diameter, elevation, etc. You can also set the tolerances for convergence and iteration.
 
## Step 5: Run Your Calculation
 
To run your calculation, you can click on the Calculate button on the toolbar or press F5 on your keyboard. The software will solve your pipe system and display the results in a summary window. You can see the flow rate and pressure drop for each pipe, fitting, valve, pump, tank, and component. You can also see the total flow rate and pressure drop for the whole system. You can also view the results in a table format or a graph format.
 
## Step 6: Generate Your Report
 
To generate your report, you can click on the Report button on the toolbar or press F6 on your keyboard. The software will create a PDF report that contains your pipe system diagram, fluid data, calculation options, and results. You can customize your report by adding a title page, a header, a footer, a logo image, etc. You can also export your report to other formats such as Excel or Word.
 
## Conclusion
 
Pipe Flow Expert is a powerful and easy-to-use software for pipe system design and analysis. It can help you model pipe systems with multiple supply points, discharge tanks, components, valves, and pumps in series or in parallel. It can also help you calculate flow rates, pipe pressure drops, and pump performance. It can also help you generate professional reports with html formatting.
