If you are looking for a powerful and versatile software solution for live sound mixing, you should check out Rml Labs Sac V3 31. This software audio console allows you to do front of house and 24 monitor mixes all on a Windows PC, with high quality audio and unprecedented mixing options. In this article, we will explain what Rml Labs Sac V3 31 is, how it works, and what benefits it can bring to your live sound production.
 
## What is Rml Labs Sac V3 31?
 
Rml Labs Sac V3 31 is the latest version of the Software Audio Console (SAC) developed by RML Labs, an innovative software design company founded by independent audio engineer, software developer and artist Bob Lentini[^1^]. SAC is a live virtual mixing system that replaces the need for large and expensive mixing consoles in live sound applications. SAC allows you to connect up to 120 inputs and 64 outputs to a single computer, and split the signal internally to 25 separate consoles: one for front of house and 24 for monitor mixes[^1^]. Each console has its own set of controls, such as mastering EQ, keying gates, compressors, aux sends, reverbs, etc. You can also link SAC to SAWStudio, another software product by RML Labs, to record live multitrack performances directly on the same host machine[^1^].

## How does Rml Labs Sac V3 31 work?
 
Rml Labs Sac V3 31 works by using a low-latency audio engine that streams audio data from the inputs to the outputs in real time. You can use any standard audio interface that supports ASIO or WDM drivers to connect your microphones, instruments, speakers, etc. to your computer. You can also use any MIDI controller or keyboard to control the faders, knobs, buttons, etc. on the SAC interface[^1^]. The SAC interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with multiple views that allow you to see the consoles from different perspectives and navigate easily. You can also set up F-Key Workspace views that give you instant recall of complex screen displays without interfering with the audio streaming[^1^]. Another feature of SAC is its TCP/IP networking capabilities. You can connect up to 28 computers to the host system through any standard ethernet hub or switch, or wireless router. These computer remotes can be used to control almost everything within the host system and user stats can be set as FOH, Monitor or Personal user rights, which dictate what each computer can have access to[^1^]. You can leave the system backstage and control FOH and Monitors from anywhere in the venue. Each performer can also tap in with a laptop computer and get access to his own personal monitor console to control his own mix[^1^].
