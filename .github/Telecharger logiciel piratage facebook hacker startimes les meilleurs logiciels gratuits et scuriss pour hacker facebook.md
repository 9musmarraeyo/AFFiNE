However, Rhinojewel is not a free software. It costs $1,995 for a single-user license and $2,995 for a network license. If you want to try it before buying it, you can download a 30-day trial version from their official website[^1^]. The trial version has all the features of the full version, except that it does not allow you to save or export your files.
 
So, how can you download Rhinojewel for free? Well, there are some unofficial ways to do that, but they are not recommended. They may involve downloading cracked versions of the software from dubious sources, which may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or compromise your personal data. They may also violate the intellectual property rights of the software developers and expose you to legal risks.
 
The best way to download Rhinojewel for free is to use alternative software that can perform similar functions as Rhinojewel. For example, you can use Rhino[^2^], which is a general-purpose 3D modeling software that can also be used for jewelry design. Rhino has many plugins that can enhance its capabilities for jewelry design, such as CrossGems[^2^], Stullerâs MatrixGoldÂ®[^2^], and CounterSketchÂ®[^2^]. Rhino costs $995 for a single-user license and $1,495 for a network license, which is cheaper than Rhinojewel. You can also download a 90-day evaluation version of Rhino for free from their website[^2^].
 
Another option is to use free or open-source software that can also create 3D models of jewelry. For example, you can use Blender[^3^], which is a powerful and versatile 3D creation suite that supports modeling, sculpting, rendering, animation, simulation, and more. Blender is completely free and open-source, and you can download it from their website[^3^]. You can also find many tutorials and resources online to help you learn how to use Blender for jewelry design.
 
In conclusion, if you want to download Rhinojewel for free, you have two options: either use alternative software that can do similar things as Rhinojewel, or use free or open-source software that can also create 3D models of jewelry. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages, so you should choose the one that suits your needs and preferences best. Happy designing!
  
## How to Choose the Best Jewelry Design Software for You
 
With so many options available, how can you choose the best jewelry design software for you? There are several factors that you should consider before making your decision, such as:
 
- Your budget: How much are you willing to spend on a jewelry design software? Some software are free or open-source, while others require a one-time payment or a subscription fee. You should also factor in the cost of hardware, such as a computer, a mouse, a tablet, or a 3D printer, that you may need to run the software smoothly and efficiently.
- Your skill level: How experienced are you with 3D modeling and jewelry design? Some software are more user-friendly and intuitive than others, while others require more technical knowledge and training. You should choose a software that matches your skill level and learning style, and that offers adequate support and resources to help you improve your skills.
- Your design goals: What kind of jewelry do you want to design? Some software are more specialized and tailored for specific types of jewelry, such as rings, earrings, bracelets, or pendants, while others are more versatile and flexible for any kind of jewelry. You should also consider the style and complexity of your designs, and the features and tools that you need to achieve them.
- Your production methods: How do you plan to produce your jewelry designs? Some software are more compatible and integrated with certain production methods, such as 3D printing, casting, milling, or engraving, while others are more general and adaptable for any production method. You should also consider the file formats and export options that the software supports, and the quality and accuracy of the output.

By considering these factors, you can narrow down your choices and find the best jewelry design software for you.
