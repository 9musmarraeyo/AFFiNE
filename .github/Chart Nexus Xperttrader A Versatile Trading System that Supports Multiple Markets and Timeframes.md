1. Define your screening criteria using the rules composer.
2. Apply your screening criteria to a list of stocks using the stock screener.
3. Evaluate the performance of your screening criteria using the backtester.

## Step 1: Define Your Screening Criteria Using the Rules Composer
 
The rules composer is a tool that lets you create your own screening criteria using technical indicators, price patterns, candlestick patterns, volume patterns and other factors. You can use logical operators, mathematical operators and parentheses to combine different conditions and create complex rules.
 
For example, you can create a rule that selects stocks that have a bullish engulfing pattern on the daily chart, a positive MACD crossover on the weekly chart and a 50-day moving average above the 200-day moving average. You can also assign weights to different conditions to prioritize them.
 
To access the rules composer, click on the "Rules Composer" tab on the top menu bar. You will see a blank workspace where you can drag and drop different indicators and conditions from the left panel. You can also edit the parameters of each indicator and condition by double-clicking on them.
 
## Step 2: Apply Your Screening Criteria to a List of Stocks Using the Stock Screener
 
The stock screener is a tool that lets you apply your screening criteria to a list of stocks and see which ones match your criteria. You can use predefined lists of stocks such as market indices, sectors or industries, or you can create your own custom lists of stocks.
 
To access the stock screener, click on the "Stock Screener" tab on the top menu bar. You will see a list of stocks on the left panel and a chart area on the right panel. You can select any stock from the list and see its chart with your screening criteria applied. You can also sort the list by different columns such as price, volume or performance.
 
To apply your screening criteria to the list of stocks, click on the "Apply Rule" button on the bottom right corner. You will see a pop-up window where you can select your rule from the drop-down menu. You can also adjust the date range and frequency of your screening. Click on "OK" to run your screening.
 
## Step 3: Evaluate the Performance of Your Screening Criteria Using the Backtester
 
The backtester is a tool that lets you evaluate the performance of your screening criteria over a historical period. It shows you how much profit or loss you would have made if you had followed your screening criteria and bought and sold stocks accordingly. It also shows you various statistics such as annualized return, maximum drawdown, win rate and risk-reward ratio.
