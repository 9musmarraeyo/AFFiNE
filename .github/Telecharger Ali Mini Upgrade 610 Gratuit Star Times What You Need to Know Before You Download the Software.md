- The firmware file for your receiver (you can find it on the official website of your receiver brand or on online forums)

## How to use Ali Mini Upgrade 6.10

1. Connect one end of the RS232 cable to the serial port of your computer and the other end to the RS232 port of your receiver.
2. Turn off your receiver from the main switch and leave it unplugged.
3. Open Ali Mini Upgrade 6.10 on your computer and select the COM port that corresponds to your RS232 cable.
4. Click on "Open File" and browse to the firmware file that you want to install on your receiver.
5. Click on "Start" and wait for the software to detect your receiver.
6. When you see a message that says "Waiting for STB", plug in your receiver and turn it on from the main switch.
7. The software will start transferring the firmware file to your receiver. You will see a progress bar and a percentage indicator on the screen.
8. When the process is completed, you will see a message that says "Upgrade OK".
9. Disconnect the RS232 cable from your receiver and your computer.

11. Your receiver should boot up normally with the new firmware installed.

## Troubleshooting tips

- If you encounter an error message that says "Bootloader version not compatible", it means that the firmware file that you are trying to install is not suitable for your receiver model. You need to find a compatible firmware file for your receiver.
- If you encounter an error message that says "No response from STB", it means that the software cannot communicate with your receiver. You need to check the connection of the RS232 cable and make sure that you have selected the correct COM port.
- If you encounter an error message that says "Upgrade failed", it means that there was a problem during the transfer of the firmware file. You need to repeat the process from step 5 and make sure that there is no interruption or power outage during the process.
