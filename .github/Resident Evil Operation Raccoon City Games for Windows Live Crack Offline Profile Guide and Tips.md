Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City is a third-person shooter game that was released in 2012 for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game is set in the fictional Raccoon City during the events of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, and features both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. However, many players have encountered problems with the game's online functionality due to the shutdown of Games for Windows Live (GFWL) service in 2014.

GFWL was a platform that provided online features such as matchmaking, achievements, leaderboards and cloud saves for many Windows games. However, due to its poor performance, security issues and lack of support, Microsoft decided to discontinue the service and migrate some of the games to Steamworks or Xbox Live. Unfortunately, Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City was not among them, and players who wanted to play online had to resort to unofficial methods such as cracks or mods.
 
In this article, we will show you how to play Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City online with GFWL using a working solution that was posted by a Steam user named \_REC\_ [^1^]. This solution involves installing an updated version of GFWL, creating a Microsoft account and deleting a file called xlive.dll from the game folder. This method has been tested by many players and confirmed to work as of April 2023. However, please note that this is not an official fix and may not work for everyone. Also, we do not condone piracy or cracking of games, and we recommend that you only use this solution if you own a legitimate copy of the game.
 
## Steps to Play Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City Online with GFWL
 
1. Uninstall any Windows Live programs you have on your computer, such as GFWL client, Marketplace or Redistributable. You can do this by going to Control Panel > Programs and Features and selecting the programs you want to remove.
2. Download the files from this link: https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/1012-microsoft-games-for-windows-live/ [^2^]. This is a package that contains an updated version of GFWL client and some other files that are needed for the solution.
3. Install only gfwlivesetup.exe (the one with the Windows symbol) from the package. This will install the latest version of GFWL client on your computer.
4. Sign into your Xbox/Microsoft account in your browser. If you don't have one, you can create one for free at https://account.microsoft.com/ [^3^]. You will need this account to log into GFWL in the game.
5. Now start the game. Click the LIVE button (Home key) on your keyboard. This will open the GFWL overlay in the game.
6. Click to sign in but uncheck all the boxes, write your email address, delete the autofill password and write yours, then check the boxes again. This will ensure that you enter your credentials correctly and avoid any errors.
7. Now wait up to 10 minutes. Your profile should start to download the necessary information from GFWL servers. You may see some messages such as "Downloading profile" or "Signing in". Be patient and do not close the game or the overlay.
8. Once your profile is downloaded, you should be able to access the online features of the game, such as co-op or versus modes. You can invite your friends who have also followed this solution or join random matches with other players.
