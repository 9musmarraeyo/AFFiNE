# How to Download Symbols for Guilds in Metin2
 
Metin2 is a popular MMORPG game that allows players to create and join guilds, which are groups of players who share common interests and goals. Guilds can have their own symbols, which are small images that represent their identity and style. In this article, we will show you how to download symbols for guilds in Metin2 and how to use them in the game.
 
## Step 1: Find a Symbol
 
The first step is to find a symbol that you like and that suits your guild. You can search for symbols on the internet, using keywords such as "simboluri pentru breasla metin2" or "symbols for guilds metin2". You can also use websites that offer free icons, such as [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) or [Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/). Alternatively, you can create your own symbol using an image editing software, such as Photoshop or GIMP.

## Step 2: Resize and Convert the Symbol
 
The second step is to resize and convert the symbol to the appropriate format and size for Metin2. The symbol must be 16x12 pixels and in TGA format. You can use an online image converter, such as [Online-Convert](http://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-tga), to change the format of your symbol. To resize your symbol, you can use an image editing software or an online tool, such as [ResizeImage](https://resizeimage.net/). Make sure to maintain the aspect ratio and quality of your symbol when resizing it.
 
## Step 3: Save and Upload the Symbol
 
The third step is to save and upload the symbol to your Metin2 folder. You can name your symbol as you wish, but make sure it has the .tga extension. Then, you need to copy and paste your symbol into the Upload folder inside your Metin2 folder. For example, if you installed Metin2 in C:\Program Files\Metin2, then you need to paste your symbol into C:\Program Files\Metin2\Upload.
 
## Step 4: Use the Symbol in the Game
 
The final step is to use the symbol in the game. To do this, you need to be the leader of a guild or have permission from the leader. You also need to have at least level 40 and pay 200,000 Yang to create a guild or change its symbol. Then, you need to talk to the Guardian NPC in any town and choose the option to create or change your guild symbol. You will see a list of symbols that you can choose from, including the one that you uploaded. Select your symbol and confirm your choice. Congratulations, you have successfully downloaded and used a symbol for your guild in Metin2!
