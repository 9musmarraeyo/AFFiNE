But before you decide to use the Callan Method book MP3 download, you should also be aware of some of its advantages and disadvantages. The Callan Method is not for everyone, and it may not suit your learning style or goals. Here are some of the pros and cons of the Callan Method:
 
## Advantages

- It is largely spoken. Some students don't like grammar, writing or long readings and listenings. The Callan Method focuses on speaking and listening, which are essential skills for communication.
- It can be very fast-paced. If you get bored by the slow moments in class, you may find that the Callan Method helps to keep you awake and engaged. The teacher asks questions quickly and randomly, so you have to pay attention and think fast.
- Lots of review. Every lesson begins with review of previous material. This helps to reinforce what you learn and move it from your short-term to your long-term memory.
- No homework. If you don't have a lot of time for language study, it can be difficult to study at home. The Callan Method is done entirely in class, so you don't have to worry about doing extra work outside.

## Disadvantages

- Some of the vocabulary can be rather old or rare. The Callan Method books were written by Robin Callan in the 1960s and have not been updated since then. They may contain some outdated or uncommon words that you may not need or use in everyday situations.
- It is restrictive and often quite tiring for both students and teachers. The Callan Method follows a rigid structure and does not allow much flexibility or creativity. The teacher has to follow the book exactly and cannot adapt the lessons to the students' needs or interests. The students have to answer as written in the book and cannot express their own opinions or ideas.
- It deals poorly with phrases, word groupings and collocation. The Callan Method teaches vocabulary in isolation, without paying attention to how words are used together in natural speech. This can lead to unnatural or incorrect sentences that sound strange to native speakers.
- It encourages fluent but not accurate speech. The Callan Method aims to make students speak quickly and confidently, but not necessarily correctly. The teacher corrects some mistakes, but not all of them, and does not explain why they are wrong. This can result in students developing bad habits or fossilized errors that are hard to correct later.

The Callan Method book MP3 download can be a useful tool for learning English, but it is not a magic solution. You should consider your own preferences, goals and needs before choosing a method that works for you. You should also supplement your learning with other sources of input and practice, such as reading books, watching movies, listening to podcasts, writing emails, speaking with native speakers, etc. The more you expose yourself to different aspects of the language, the more you will learn and improve.
