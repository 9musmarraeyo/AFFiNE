Pokemon X And Y are the latest games in the Pokemon series, released for Nintendo 3DS in 2013. They introduce a new region, new Pokemon, new features, and a new dimension of gameplay with 3D graphics. But what if you want to play these games on your old Game Boy Advance? Is there a way to enjoy Pokemon X And Y on a retro console?
 
The answer is yes, thanks to some fan-made hacks and emulators. There are several versions of Pokemon X And Y for Game Boy Advance that you can download for free and play on your computer or mobile device. These hacks are based on existing Pokemon games for GBA, such as Fire Red, Emerald, or Ruby, but they modify the graphics, music, story, and gameplay to resemble Pokemon X And Y as much as possible.

Some of the features that these hacks include are:
 
- New Pokemon from the Kalos region, including the starters Chespin, Fennekin, and Froakie, and their evolutions.
- New Mega Evolutions for some Pokemon, such as Charizard, Blastoise, and Mewtwo.
- New Fairy type and moves, which are effective against Dragon type Pokemon.
- New battle modes, such as Sky Battles and Horde Encounters.
- New locations and characters from the Kalos region, such as Lumiose City, Professor Sycamore, and Team Flare.
- New mini-games and features, such as Pokemon-Amie and Super Training.

Of course, these hacks are not perfect and may have some bugs or glitches. They also cannot replicate the full 3D experience of Pokemon X And Y on a 2D platform. But they are still impressive and fun to play for any Pokemon fan who wants to try something different.

To play these hacks, you will need a GBA emulator for your device. There are many options available for different platforms, such as Visual Boy Advance for Windows or My Boy! for Android. You will also need to download the ROM file of the hack you want to play and load it on your emulator. Then you can enjoy Pokemon X And Y on your Game Boy Advance!
  
But how do these hacks compare to the original Pokemon X And Y games for 3DS? Well, according to some reviews, the 3DS games are among the best in the series, with stunning 3D graphics, a huge world to explore, and a lot of new features and improvements. They also have a more engaging story and characters than previous games, and a more balanced difficulty level. Some of the highlights of the 3DS games are:

- The new Player Search System (PSS), which allows you to connect with other players online or locally for battles, trades, chat, and more.
- The new Pokemon Global Link (PGL), which lets you access various online services and features, such as rating battles, global missions, and special events.
- The new Wonder Trade, which lets you trade any Pokemon with a random player around the world.
- The new Pokemon Bank, which lets you store up to 3000 Pokemon online and transfer them between different games.
- The new Poke Transporter, which lets you transfer Pokemon from previous games to Pokemon Bank.

Of course, the 3DS games are not without their flaws. Some of the criticisms that have been raised are:
