# How to Download and Install MiG-29 for DCS World
 
DCS World is a realistic combat flight simulator that lets you fly various aircraft in different scenarios. One of the most popular aircraft in DCS World is the MiG-29, a twin-engined, supersonic fighter that can carry up to 4,000 Kg of ordnance on 7 hardpoints[^3^]. If you want to fly the MiG-29 in DCS World, you have two options: you can buy the official module from the DCS website, or you can download a free mod that adds an English cockpit and custom liveries to the MiG-29.
 
## Option 1: Buy the Official Module

## Option 2: Download a Free Mod
 
If you do not want to spend money on the official module, you can still fly the MiG-29 in DCS World by downloading a free mod that adds an English cockpit and custom liveries to the MiG-29. The mod is compatible with only DCS World v2.7.x and above, and it passes the integrity check, so you can use it online. The mod was made based on the stock cockpit textures, and it provides full English labels for all the switches and gauges in the MiG-29 cockpit. The mod also includes several custom liveries for the MiG-29, such as the Ghost of Kyiv[^2^], a fictional flying ace credited with shooting down six Russian planes in the Kyiv offensive on 24 February 2023. To download the mod, you need to have DCS World installed on your PC. If you do not have DCS World installed, you can download it for free from [here](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/downloads/world/). Once you have DCS World installed, you can download the mod from [here](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/2081947/). After you download the mod, you need to extract it to your Saved Games\\DCS.openbeta\\Liveries\\mig-29s folder. Then you can select the MiG-29 in DCS World and enjoy flying it with an English cockpit and custom liveries.
