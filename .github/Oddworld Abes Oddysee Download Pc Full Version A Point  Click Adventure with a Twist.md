Here are some tips or tricks for playing the game:

- Save often. The game has many checkpoints, but they are not always obvious. You can save manually by pressing Esc and selecting "QuikSave". You can also load your last save by pressing Esc and selecting "QuikLoad".
- Use Abe's abilities wisely. Abe can use his mind control power to possess enemies or animals and use them to solve puzzles or eliminate threats. He can also use his chanting power to open portals and rescue Mudokons. However, both powers have limitations and risks. For example, some enemies wear helmets that prevent mind control, and some areas have electric fields that zap Abe if he chants.
- Explore every area. The game has many secrets and hidden areas that can reward you with extra lives, power-ups, or passwords. Some of them require you to use special abilities or items to access them. Some of them are also very well hidden and require careful observation or trial and error.
