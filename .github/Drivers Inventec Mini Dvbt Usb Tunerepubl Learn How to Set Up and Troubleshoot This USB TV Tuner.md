## Step 1: Download the Drivers
 
The first step is to download the drivers for the Inventec Mini DVB-T USB Tuner from the official website. You can find the download link here: [https://www.inventec.com/drivers/inventec-mini-dvb-t-usb-tuner.epubl](https://www.inventec.com/drivers/inventec-mini-dvb-t-usb-tuner.epubl). The file size is about 15 MB and it is in EPUBL format.
 
EPUBL is a file format that is commonly used for e-books and digital publications. It is designed to be compatible with various devices and platforms. However, it is not a standard format for drivers, so you will need a special software to open it and extract the drivers from it.
 
We recommend using Calibre, a free and open-source e-book management software that can handle EPUBL files. You can download Calibre from here: [https://calibre-ebook.com/download](https://calibre-ebook.com/download). After downloading and installing Calibre, launch it and add the EPUBL file to your library by clicking on the "Add books" button.
  
## Step 2: Extract the Drivers
 
Once you have added the EPUBL file to your Calibre library, you can extract the drivers from it by following these steps:
 
- Select the EPUBL file in your library and right-click on it.
- Choose "Extract ISBN" from the context menu. This will create a folder with the same name as the EPUBL file in your Calibre library folder.
- Open the folder and look for a file named "drivers.zip". This is the compressed file that contains the drivers for the Inventec Mini DVB-T USB Tuner.
- Extract the contents of the "drivers.zip" file to a location of your choice. You can use any unzip software such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.

You should now have a folder with several files and subfolders that are related to the drivers. The main file that you need to install is called "Setup.exe".
  
## Step 3: Install the Drivers
 
The final step is to install the drivers by running the "Setup.exe" file. To do this, follow these steps:

- Connect your Inventec Mini DVB-T USB Tuner to an available USB port on your computer.
- Double-click on the "Setup.exe" file that you extracted from the EPUBL file.
- Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process. You may need to restart your computer after the installation is finished.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the drivers for your Inventec Mini DVB-T USB Tuner. You can now use it with any compatible software that supports DVB-T tuners, such as Windows Media Center or VLC Media Player.
