## How does SoftActivity Monitor work?
  
SoftActivity Monitor works by installing a small agent on each employee's computer that records and sends all their activity data to a secure cloud server. You can then access and view their activity data from any web browser using your SoftActivity account. You can also set up alerts and reports to get notified of any suspicious or inappropriate actions by your employees.
  
## What can SoftActivity Monitor do for you?
  
SoftActivity Monitor can help you monitor your employees' computers and activities in real time or in stealth mode (if your company has users consent to collection of information). You can see what they are doing on their screens, what websites they are visiting, what applications they are using, what keystrokes they are typing, what files they are transferring, and more. You can also see how much time they spend working or being idle, and how productive they are. You can also take screenshots, record videos, block websites or applications, send messages, or remotely control their computers if needed.
