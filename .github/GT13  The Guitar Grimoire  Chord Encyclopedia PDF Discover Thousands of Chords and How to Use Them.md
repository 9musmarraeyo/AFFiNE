Chord theory explains how chords are derived from scales, and how they are classified by their intervals, qualities, and types. By learning chord theory, you will be able to recognize and play any chord on the guitar, as well as create your own chord shapes and voicings.
 
Some of the topics covered by guitar chord theory include:
 
- Major and minor chords: These are the most common and basic chords, which consist of three notes: the root, the third, and the fifth. The third determines whether the chord is major or minor. For example, C major has the notes C, E, and G, while C minor has the notes C, Eb, and G.
- Suspended chords: These are chords that replace the third with either the second or the fourth, creating a suspended sound that needs to be resolved. For example, Csus2 has the notes C, D, and G, while Csus4 has the notes C, F, and G.
- Augmented and diminished chords: These are chords that alter the fifth by raising it or lowering it by a half step, creating a tense and unstable sound. For example, Caug has the notes C, E, and G#, while Cdim has the notes C, Eb, and Gb.
- Seventh chords: These are chords that add a seventh interval to the basic triad, creating a more complex and colorful sound. There are different types of seventh chords depending on the quality of the seventh and the triad. For example, Cmaj7 has the notes C, E, G, and B, while Cm7 has the notes C, Eb, G, and Bb.
- Extended chords: These are chords that add higher intervals beyond the seventh, such as the ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth. These chords create a rich and sophisticated sound that is often used in jazz and fusion. For example, C9 has the notes C, E, G, Bb, and D.
