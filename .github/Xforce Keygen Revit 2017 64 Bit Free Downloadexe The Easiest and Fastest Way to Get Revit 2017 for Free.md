- It supports BIM (Building Information Modeling), which allows you to create and manage data-rich models that can be used for design, analysis, simulation, and documentation.
- It has a parametric modeling system, which means that any change you make to one element will automatically update all related elements. This saves you time and reduces errors.
- It has a variety of tools and features for architectural, structural, MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing), and landscape design. You can also use Revit extensions and add-ins to enhance its functionality.
- It has a collaborative workflow, which enables you to work with other team members on the same project using cloud services or local servers. You can also share your models with other software such as AutoCAD, SketchUp, 3ds Max, and more.
- It has a powerful rendering engine, which allows you to create realistic and high-quality images and animations of your designs. You can also use VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality) technologies to experience your models in immersive ways.
