GT Legends is a racing game that features classic cars from the 1960s and 1970s. It was released in 2005 and used StarForce v3 protection to prevent piracy. However, this protection is incompatible with Windows 7 and newer operating systems, and can cause problems such as system crashes, blue screens, and driver conflicts. Moreover, some players may not have access to the original CD or DVD of the game, or may prefer not to use it for convenience.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to play GT Legends on Windows 7 without CD, using a no-CD crack that bypasses the StarForce protection. A no-CD crack is a modified executable file that replaces the original one and allows the game to run without checking for the CD. This crack also works for other languages and versions of the game, such as English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Hungarian, Czech, Polish, and Russian.

Here are the steps to install and use the no-CD crack for GT Legends on Windows 7:
 
1. Install the game from the original CD or DVD, or from a digital download.
2. Download and install the official patch v1.1.0.0 from the game's website or from another source. This patch fixes some bugs and adds some features to the game.
3. Download the no-CD crack archive from one of the web search results[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. The archive contains two files: GTL.exe and DECOMPRESS.BAT.
4. Extract the no-CD crack archive to the game directory, where the original GTL.exe file is located. Overwrite the existing files when prompted.
5. Run DECOMPRESS.BAT as administrator. This will decompress some files in the game directory and make them compatible with the no-CD crack.
6. Run GTL.exe as administrator. The game should start without asking for the CD.
